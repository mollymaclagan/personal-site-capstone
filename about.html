                    Some key background information unrelated to my professional life:
                    I was born and raised in northeast Ohio, and transplanted to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 2010. I am the middle of three sisters (insert Chekhov reference here).
                    I am an ambivert, meaning it's a coin-toss whether I get energy from being with others or by myself.

                    Read on to learn more about my personal interests and professional background.

                        <p>Pursuing my curiosity with passion leads me exactly where I should be professionally.</p>

                <p class="overview">
                    I am passionately eclectic. The bulk of my career has been in the nonprofit sector, and has included everything from
                    theatrical direction and fundraising to technical project management and content creation in the health and wellness space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each of these spheres may seem unrelated, but I am confident that pursuing my curiosity with passion has led me to exactly where 
                    I should be professionally. Doing so taught me to learn quickly and rapidly pivot in response to circumstance.
                </p> 
                <p>In addition, this breadth of experience has also allowed me to identify and leverage unexpected connections between seemingly disparate fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the diversity of my professional background has introduced me to new communities, providing me with the opportunity to interact with people from 
                    all walks of life and challenging me to live my values of engaging with differing (and even contradictory) perspectives.
